			This site focuses on the 3 types of pollution in the Earth and information about them. 
			We will focus on explaining and showing the different type of pollution, the causes, 
			the effects, and the preventative measures and to spread awareness to people about our 
			dying planet. People nowadays are very ignorant and pollute the environment all the time, 
			intentional or not. According to some research, we humans are consuming so much resources 
			too fast and produce too much waste to the point that our next generations will have less 
			resources than now. On top of the continuous consumption and production, the habitats of 
			animals are starting to decline, resulting in extinction. We all know life is very rare and 
			we are considered lucky since we get to live here on Earth. However, we will soon deplete all 
			of our resources and the extinction of life will happen because of our actions. Trying to change 
			the world is not easy, but we can do it one step at a time!

			<h3 class="subheader" id="what">What is Pollution?</h3>
			<p>
			According to National Geographic, "Pollution is the introduction of 
			harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are 
			called pollutants." <br> <br>
			Pollution is basically the act of adding different harmful things to the 
			environment, causing it to degrade and eventually be destroyed. <br> <br>
			Because of the continuous act of harming the environment, many problems 
			may arise immediately or in the long run.<br> <br>
			Below is a video from Crash Course about pollution: <br>

			<h3 class="subheader" id="types">Different Types of Pollution</h3>
			<p>
				Pollution is the collective term for the many different types of 
				pollution. In this site, we will only talk about the 3 main types, 
				which are: <br> <br>

			<h3 class="subheader" id="prevnsol">Solutions and Prevention</h3>
			<p>
				Pollution can be mitigated and controlled with effort. However, 
				different types of pollution means different solutions and preventive 
				measures are to be done and taken. Since a general 'cure' isn't available, 
				we sometimes don't care and carelessly do things that harm the environment 
				on a gradual scale.
